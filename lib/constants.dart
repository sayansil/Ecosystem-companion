    "new organisms with custom characteristics and also bring changes to the "
    "ecosystem and then observe their behavior and reaction to those changes. "
    "Thus the user can be looked upon as The God of the ecosystem who has the "
    "power to bring any change with which he can simulate the problems "
    "happening worldwide and gain valuable insights on how the organisms try "
    "to adapt to the change to ensure their survival. Studying the overall "
    "behavior of the ecosystem will provide us with a wealth of knowledge and "
    "be far better prepared for how we should be equipped to handle the "
    "future.";
